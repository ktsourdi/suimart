# White Screen Issue Analysis and Fixes

## Summary
Your Suimart application at https://suimart-chi.vercel.app/ was showing a white screen due to build configuration issues. After analyzing the build logs, I identified and fixed the root cause.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ **FIXED: Build Configuration Conflict**
**Issue**: The build was failing with:
```
Error: The file "/vercel/path0/frontend/out/routes-manifest.json" couldn't be found. This is often caused by a misconfiguration in your project.
```

**Root Cause**: Conflicting configurations between Next.js static export and Vercel's expectations.

**Fix Applied**:
- **Removed static export configuration** from `next.config.js`:
  ```javascript
  // Removed: output: 'export',
  ```
- **Deleted `vercel.json`** to let Vercel auto-detect Next.js configuration
- This allows Vercel to handle the deployment optimally with dynamic features

### 2. ‚úÖ **VERIFIED: Build Process**
**Status**: Build now completes successfully
```
‚úì Compiled successfully
‚úì Linting and checking validity of types
‚úì Collecting page data
‚úì Generating static pages (5/5)
‚úì Collecting build traces
‚úì Finalizing page optimization
```

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **STILL NEEDS ATTENTION: Environment Variables**
**Issue**: The application requires environment variables to be set in Vercel dashboard.

**Required Variables**:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_PACKAGE`: Your deployed Sui package ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUI_NETWORK`: Target network (e.g., "devnet")

**How to Fix**:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add the variables listed above
3. The next deployment will pick up these changes automatically

## Build Verification
‚úÖ **Local build successful**: The application builds correctly without errors
‚úÖ **Configuration fixed**: No more routes-manifest.json errors
‚úÖ **Static generation working**: All pages prerender successfully

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ **Build configuration fixed** - Changes are committed and will deploy automatically
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Set environment variables** in Vercel dashboard (still required for full functionality)

### Expected Behavior After Fix
Once the new deployment completes, you should see:
- **No more white screen** - The application will load properly
- The Suimart header and interface
- Either a "Configuration Required" banner (if environment variables aren't set yet)
- Or actual marketplace listings (if proper package ID is set)
- Working "Connect Wallet" button

## Why This Fix Works Better

### Previous Approach (Static Export)
- Used `output: 'export'` in Next.js configuration
- Generated static files in `out` directory
- **Problem**: Incompatible with dynamic features like wallet connections
- **Problem**: Vercel expected different file structure

### New Approach (Standard Next.js)
- Let Vercel handle Next.js deployment optimally
- Better compatibility with dynamic features
- **Benefit**: Automatic optimization and caching
- **Benefit**: Better error handling and debugging

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Build configuration fixed
- ‚úÖ Build process working correctly
- ‚úÖ Ready for deployment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Environment variables still need to be set for full functionality

## Files Modified
- `frontend/next.config.js` - Removed static export configuration
- `frontend/vercel.json` - Deleted (let Vercel auto-detect)
- `TROUBLESHOOTING_WHITE_SCREEN.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- `WHITE_SCREEN_ANALYSIS.md` - This analysis

## Resolution Timeline
1. **Initial Issue**: White screen on deployed app
2. **First Fix**: Corrected output directory in vercel.json
3. **Build Error**: routes-manifest.json missing due to config conflict
4. **Final Fix**: Removed static export, let Vercel auto-detect ‚úÖ

The white screen issue should now be **completely resolved** with the next deployment! üéâ

## Deprecated Dependencies Note
The project uses deprecated `@mysten/wallet-kit` packages. Consider upgrading to `@mysten/dapp-kit` in the future for better support and security updates.
