# White Screen Issue Analysis and Fixes

## Summary
Your Suimart application at https://suimart-chi.vercel.app/ is showing a white screen despite successful deployment. After analyzing the codebase, I identified and fixed several issues.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ **FIXED: Incorrect Output Directory in vercel.json**
**Issue**: The `vercel.json` was configured to use `.next` as the output directory, but Next.js static export (configured in `next.config.js`) outputs to the `out` directory.

**Fix Applied**:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "out",  // Changed from ".next" to "out"
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

### 2. ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION: Environment Variables**
**Issue**: The application requires environment variables to be set in Vercel dashboard, but they're likely not configured.

**Required Variables**:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_PACKAGE`: Your deployed Sui package ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUI_NETWORK`: Target network (e.g., "devnet")

**How to Fix**:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add the variables listed above
3. Redeploy the application

## Build Verification
✅ **Local build successful**: The application builds correctly and generates all required files:
- `out/index.html` (main page)
- `out/_next/` (Next.js assets)
- `out/sell/` (sell page)
- Static files are correctly generated

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Deploy the vercel.json fix** - This is now committed and ready
2. **Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard** - Critical for functionality
3. **Redeploy the application** - Trigger a new deployment

### Expected Behavior After Fix
Once the environment variables are set, you should see:
- The Suimart header and interface
- Either a "Configuration Required" banner (if using fallback values)
- Or actual marketplace listings (if proper package ID is set)
- Working "Connect Wallet" button

### Alternative Quick Test
If the white screen persists after setting environment variables, try this temporary test:
1. Remove `output: 'export'` from `next.config.js`
2. Delete `vercel.json` temporarily
3. Let Vercel auto-detect the Next.js configuration
4. If this works, the issue is with static export configuration

## Current Status
- ✅ Build process works correctly
- ✅ Output directory configuration fixed
- ⚠️ Environment variables need to be set in Vercel
- ⚠️ Need to redeploy with fixes

## Most Likely Cause
The white screen is most likely caused by **missing environment variables** in the Vercel deployment. The application is configured to use fallback values locally (via `.env.local`), but these aren't available in the deployed environment.

## Deprecated Dependencies Note
The project uses deprecated `@mysten/wallet-kit` packages. Consider upgrading to `@mysten/dapp-kit` in the future for better support and security updates.
