# Bug Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the bugs that were identified and fixed in the Suimart project.

## Frontend Bugs Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies
**Issue**: Build failed with "next: not found" error  
**Fix**: Ran `npm install` to install all required dependencies  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. Missing Environment Configuration
**Issue**: `.env.local` file was missing, causing potential runtime issues  
**Fix**: Created `.env.local` file with proper configuration structure  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Smart Contract Bugs Fixed

### 1. Missing SUI Import
**Issue**: The contract used `Balance<SUI>` but didn't import the SUI module  
**Fix**: Added `use sui::sui::SUI;` and `use sui::coin::{Self, Coin};`  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. Invalid Function Signatures
**Issue**: Functions returned objects directly instead of being proper entry functions  
**Fix**: Changed all public functions to `public entry` functions that don't return values  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. Incorrect Object Handling
**Issue**: Attempted to use non-existent `transfer::public_destroy_object` function  
**Fix**: 
- Changed listings to be shared objects using `transfer::share_object`
- Properly destructured objects and used `object::delete` for UIDs
- Used `transfer::public_transfer` for transferring items
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 4. Incorrect Payment Type
**Issue**: Used `Balance<SUI>` instead of `Coin<SUI>` for payments  
**Fix**: Changed payment parameter to `Coin<SUI>` and used `coin::value()` to check amount  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 5. Event Emission Syntax
**Issue**: Used generic syntax for event emission which is deprecated  
**Fix**: Updated to use non-generic `event::emit()` syntax  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Build Status

- **Frontend**: ✅ Builds successfully with no errors

   cd contracts
   sui move test  # Run tests
   sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000  # Deploy
   ```

3. Update the `.env.local` file with your deployed package ID

4. The application is now ready to run:
